[INTRO] I fell through the dark ground.

[VERSE 1]
I hit a wall;
Fell through a hole;
Nothing is around;
Its like I fell through the dark ground;
Nothing lighting my way;
I was down down down;
This was on repeat;
Never was on my knee;
I fell through the dark ground;
It’s as if trouble was attached to me;
No one can set me free;
I fell through the dark ground; ground;  ground;
No one can help-me… but me;
I fell through the dark ground.

[CHORUS]Falling from grace;
Backslide backsliding;
Falling froom grace;
Backslide backsliding;
Falllllling from grrrace;
Backslide backsliding;
I was falling through the ground; ground; ground.

[VERSE2]]Grew up with grace;
Faith was always lightning the way;
Now it’s dark; Life got hard;
My name was giving, bad face;
In the day, people didn’t care;
What did I do?;
How did I get here?;
Who are you?
How do I go home?
I need it all back;
My sanity; My strength; My Power;
And my graacccceee… my gracccee; My grace;
But theirs no turning around;
where do I continue onto now?

[CHORUS]Falling from grace;
Backslide backsliding;
Falling froom grace;
Backslide backsliding;
Falllllling from grrrace;
Backslide backsliding;
I was falling through the ground; ground; ground.

[VERSE3]Felt like I was walking on fire;
Towards agony-after agony;
Towards another nightmare;
Agony-after agony;
Eyes on me heavy;
I gave up my strength;
I was like a flower;
Losing it’s petals;
Falling to the ground;
One by one;
The flower got sadder, smaller;
Till it was just a steam;
Bare , exposed & fragile;
Coming out of the ground;

[CHORUS]Falling from grace;
Backslide backsliding;
Falling froom grace;
Backslide backsliding;
Falllllling from grrrace;
Backslide backsliding;
I was falling through the ground; ground; ground.

[Verse4]
Not the sweetest blissful feelings;
Finally I fell onto my knees;
Not the sweetest bliss feelings;
I need my grace back;
Need my worth;
Need the people looking at me;
Finding their hope!; And not thinking
that I'm the jerk.
I need my grace back;
Need my worth;
Am I even living in sin?;
Think it just looks that way;
I go to bed;
With a smile on my face;
When I’m asleep;
Feel like I’ve been tested then & there;
Nightmares everyday;
It’s a recurring demand.

[BRIDGE]Still on my knees;
Lost my power; I need my power;
Lost my grace; I need my grace;
My name will be cleared again;
It will be saved;
I’m on my knees now;
Taking care!

[CHORUS]Falling from grace;
Backslide backsliding;
Falling froom grace;
Backslide backsliding;
Falllllling from grrrace;
Backslide backsliding;
I was falling through the ground; ground; ground.

[OUTRO]Grace…—-////grace, grace grace ; grace; I gotta have GRACE!!
