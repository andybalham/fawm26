verse
Yet lonely it grows among whispering sheep
And as evening fall the dread settles weep
It weighs on the heart,  As dark shadows
In a world where the truth runs shallow.

chorus
We listen and none dare questioning why,
Hands stay clean as the line moves on,
Just following words, just staying in time,
While silence signs how fear begun.

verse
Stretch long across the mind, where hope trembles and fall
We listen in silence, where darkness rise tall
When fear takes hold, its grip holds fast
Hearts beats to the sound of boots  from the past

chorus
We listen and none dare questioning why,
Hands stay clean as the line moves on,
Just following words, just staying in time,
While silence signs how fear begun.

Verse
As crowds rise to cheer at words they barely hear,
Eyes glance away, pretending nothing’s near,
Flags held high as reason fades to dust,
While old mistakes return in quiet trust.
