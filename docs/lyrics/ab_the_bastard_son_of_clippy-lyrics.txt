Another email, another message
Another post, another tweet
It’s modern life overload
That’s overwhelming me

A solution, to my problem
Has arrived, and just in time
With the click of a button
I hit the auto-reply

[Chorus]
It’s the bastard son of Clippy
At each and every turn
“Would you like some help with that?”
While the planet burns
Yes, the bastard son of Clippy
Wants to burrow inside your life
Strip away your humanity
One click at a time

Now I offload, my interactions
Now I never, have to think
With my bestie, Clippy Junior
It’s all win, win, win

He’s freed me, from the hassle
He’s freed me, from the chore
Of maintaining my connections
My friendships and much more

[Chorus]

Now the agents, call the agents
Those agents, return the calls
Will the agents, start to realise
They don’t need us at all
