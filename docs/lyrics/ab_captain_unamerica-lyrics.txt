What if Batman started robbin’?
What if Iceman lost his cool?
What if Hulk took what he liked?
What are we meant to do?

Well across theAtlantic
Superhero’s gone rogue
They used to fight for freedom
But not fighting no more

[Chorus]
Captain Un-America, Captain Un-America
Captain Un-America, Captain Un-America
No truth, no justice, the new American way
Good guys finish last, so it’s America first today

The Captain’s had an epiphany
Hey, what’s in it for me?
This moral code has locked me in
And I’m gonna break free

I’ll bully, and I’ll threaten
You’ll feel my rage
I’ll pillage and I’ll plunder
On a global scale

[Chorus]

O say can you see, the dawn of the right
Proudly amoral, in freedom’s twilight
The star-spangled banner, laid on the grave
Of the land of the free, and home of the brave
