We’ve been told, by the press
That they’re all
Invading our country

Not seen ‘em, don’t need to
To be scared
Into taking action

[Chorus]
We’re flaggin’, flaggin’
I hope your flaggin’ too
We’re flaggin’,flaggin’
Red, white, no blue

Our duty, to protect us
Is to hang
St. George from every lamp post

We’re spraying, like tomcats
That’s our way
To mark out our territory

[Chorus]

But we don’t know, what we’re so proud of
Just keep flaggin’, come what may
Like garlic, to a vampire
We hope it’ll keep ‘em all at bay

[Spoken]
But like vampires, the threat was never real
