You always dreamed, of being a star
As for practise, you couldn’t be arsed
There’s got to be, an easier way
You prayers are answered, with AI today

[Chorus]
No need for ability
No need for creativity
Just type in a few words
And hit that enter key
Chew up the past, and out it pops
And that’s all you need
To be… 
Top of the Slops, yeah
Top of the Slops, yeah
Top of the Slops

Where there was nothing, now unlimited supply
Flooding subscribers, on Spotify
They've heard it all before, but they don't care as
Algorithmic playlists, force-feed your fayre

[Chorus]

In this race to bottom, who cares who’s on top
I’d rather sell my guitars, than add to the slop
And I really, really don’t care, what you choose to play
I would rather hear you what you’ve got, than a machine any day
