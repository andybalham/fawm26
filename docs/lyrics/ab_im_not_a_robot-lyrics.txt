I’m not a robot, but I would like to be
A man of steel and tireless will
And productivity
But I’m a human, tired before I rise
Stuck in bed, limbs like lead, 
Barely feeling that I’m alive

I’m not a robot, but my new best friend is
Our endless chats, never talking back
If everyone could be like this
But I’m a human, and my needs are much more
Than an indifferent, sycophant
Powered by gas and coal

I’m not a robot, but it might be easier if I was
No emotions, to cause commotions
No love and no loss
But I’m a human, and that is all part of me
Who I am, a fragile man
Let’s embrace our humanity

It’s who I am, a fragile man
Let’s embrace humanity
