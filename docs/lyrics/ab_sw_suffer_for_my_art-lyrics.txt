High on castle walls
In a cemetery
I've been seeking ghosts
But they've been avoiding me

Down in musty vaults
On an old battle field
I've been hunting ghosts
But not a single spectre seen

(Chorus)
I want to feel a chill down my spine
Need to sense a squeeze on my heart
I want to be a tortured poet
And suffer for my art

Out on a misty lake
At the dusk of dawn
Where the legend of
The drowned bride was born

In an asylum
Cobwebbed corridors
You could rot here if
You were ill and poor

(Chorus)

Still the wraiths won't show for me
I'm cursed and all alone
How am I to create poetry?
With no deathly moans

(Chorus)

Damn you cruel ghosts
Why do you shun me so?
It’s three o’clock in the morning
Sitting on a cold gravestone
