[Chorus]
Let’s go! Let’s go! Human fracking
Exploit the fissures of the mind
Let’s go! Let’s go! Human cracking
Monetise mankind
Half their waking hours, glued to their screens
Let’s go down into the mine and plunder this seam

Turn up the pressure, turn up the volume
Keep ‘em scrolling, with new content
Keep ‘em hooked, keep ‘em on it
That’s how, we make our profit

[Chorus]

No one stopped us, no one tried
Now we've drilled inside your mind
Your focus, our black gold
A commodity to be bought and sold

[Chorus]

Don't look at that flower 
Don't look at that tree
Or you'll threaten the basis
Of our entire economy 
Keep your eyes lowered
Keep staring at that glass
'Cos if you paid us no attention
We'd vanish up our arse
