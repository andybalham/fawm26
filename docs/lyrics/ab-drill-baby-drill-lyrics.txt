The surgeon general’s been warning me
About my filthy habit and longevity
But I feel just fine, so is he?
Part of some do-good conspiracy

[Chorus]
Drill, baby drill
Take another drag on that cigarette
Drill, baby drill
Take another drag in the face of death
They say that they’ll kill you
They say that you’ll choke
But I’m living proof
That it just a hoax

They’re out to take my pleasure away
My god-given right to fill an ashtray
It’s the land of the free, the USA
So I’ll puff away till my dying day

[Chorus]

Facts can be denied
It so easy to pretend
But science cannot be defied
It’ll get you in the end
