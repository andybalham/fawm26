In the slums of Heliopolis they barter love for rain
On the streets of Minneapolis they’ve rose above pain
Wicked gods shining like Lucifer on Monday morn
In the dreary dungeon teary revolution is born

[Chorus] 
Need I mention the glorious imperfection
From endless greed there is no protection
There are sins galore in the collection
Need I mention your glorious imperfection
 
Hitler syndrome is resonating hating in God’s kingdom
Every coin has three sides and lies hold dark wisdom
Push push in the bush Lady Liberty a victim of rape
From the red dragon of Armageddon there’s no escape
 
[Chorus] 
 
Here we go nice and slow there’s a white buffalo
It’s one for the money so welcome to the show
They’ve forgotten picking cotton’s a thankless job
The man of lawlessness is a regular slob
 
[Chorus] 

[Bridge?] 
This ain’t the America I learned about in kindergarten
The land of the free you yearned for the begotten
When God gives you over to sin your heart is hard
On the battlefield never yield from your guard
 
I was thinking about the idea of me and you
About Mother Earth green and the sky so blue
Eve I believe that Eden was made for two
When they kick in your front door what ya gonna do?
 
[Chorus]
