Accidents will happen, at Lowermoor in eighty-eight
Accidents will happen, twenty tonnes of poison sulphate
Accidents will happen, dumped into the water supply
Of unknowing folk, as they woke
To go about their daily lives

Accidents will happen, the water was blue and green
Accidents will happen, people started calling in
Accidents will happen, it burns when I wash
They were told it’s safe, and for the taste
Mix it with orange squash

Accidents will happen, and water was to be privatised
Accidents will happen, but keep them out of investors eyes
Accidents will happen, to hell with the human cost
Tell them it’s safe, and for the taste
Mix it with orange squash

Accidents will happen, twenty thousand poisoned lives
Accidents will happen, but no one held to rights
Accidents will happen, justice forever lost
Just told it’s safe, and for the taste
Mix it with orange squash
