Dust has settled, smoke has cleared
The monster has been slain
Into a thousand parts

But just before the credits roll
Fragments start to move
Reforming before our eyes

[Chorus]
‘Cos it’s T2: Judgement Day
The Tories are back, they’re just renamed
With the same old faces, same dark hearts
It’s up to us to tell them apart
It’s T2: Judgement Day

A cold machine, in human form
More evil than the last
And it wants to rule again

It’s up to us, to cast a vote
And make our voices heard
Before it gets too late

[Chorus]

They’ve been putting up the flags
And ramping up the hate
Doesn’t matter how they paint it
The message is the same
They’re pushing for more mileage
Our chance is wearing thin
‘Cos five years is forever
If they ever get to win

[Chorus]
