Caught between two stools
A rock and a hard place
You like to say you follow Christ
But he sets a tough old pace 

How to love thy neighbour
When you wish they'd not moved in
The solution is simple
See empathy as a sin

[Chorus]
When you feel your conscience nagging at your soul
When they look like people just needing a home 
Then turn to the Devil and let him know
That he'll never win
That empathy is a sin 

Now you're free to do His work
You're no longer confused
What used to feel just plain wrong
Can be easily excused

Unencumbered by those thoughts
Of human suffering
You can now get onboard
With your vengeful king

[Chorus]

Let's get on board with the alt right
Join together in our fight
To rid ourselves of this guilty blight
So we can soundly sleep at night
