Where there was silence
We brought the noise
Where there was quiet
We are your inner voice

[Pre-chorus]
You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
We’re gonna feed it

[Chorus]
We got inside your head
We got inside your soul
We planted the seed that make
You want more
Now you can never sleep
Unless you pay
For the pills that we make
To take the noise away

Where there is discord
There’s opportunity
Which we can maximise
For profitability

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

You’re just cattle to farm
In our grand scheme
Pumped full of desire
And cacophony
Milked until you’re dry
In an endless din
Trapped by your wires
You can never win

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
