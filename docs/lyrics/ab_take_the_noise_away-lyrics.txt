We don’t want little Johnny
To see bad things
On the device
That we bought for him

Plugging him into
The algorithmic feed
Grabbing his attention
Mining in for greed

[Chorus]
Think! Think of the children
As your rights are taken away
Think! Think of the children
Privacy’s so yesterday
If your papers are not in order
Then we can’t let you in
Your anonymity
Consigned to the bin

Online information
Starts to disappear
Litigation 
Precipitates fear

Wikipedia 
Needs your id
And now the watchers
Can see what you see

[Chorus]

It’s a big tech wet dream
Perfect tracking scheme
Take what you’ve seen
Beam ads to your screen

[Chorus]
