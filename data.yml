  - title: Accidents Will Happen (Mix It With Orange Squash)
    mp3Filename: ab_accidents_will_happen
    notes: |
      This is the true story of Britain's worst mass poisoning, when twenty thousand people had aluminium sulphate dumped into their water supply.

      Those people included the mother of one of my closest friends. None of them got justice. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelford_water_pollution_incident

      Don't believe in heroes.
  - title: I'm Not A Robot

      After being repeatedly questioned on this topic, here are my musings on the possibility.
  - title: Human Fracking
    mp3Filename: ab_human_fracking
    notes: |
      New technology brings new exploitation. Our attention is what they want and they want to use it to divide us. 
  - title: The Bastard Son of Clippy

    notes: |
      Like a pusher they are trying to get us hooked on AI, when what we need is to give each other a little human attention.
  - title: "T2: Judgement Day"
    mp3Filename: ab_t2_judgement_day
    notes: |
      At the end of the last movie the Tories tore themselves apart. Now like the T1000, they are reforming themselves as something even worse than before. Judgement Day at the ballot box will be upon us soon. As Sarah Conner once said "The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
  - title: Take the Noise Away
    mp3Filename: ab_take_the_noise_away
    notes: |
      On one hand they bombard us with ads for junk food, on the other they sell us a solution to keep out the noise. The perfect pincer movement.
  - title: Top of the Slops
    mp3Filename: ab_top_of_the_slops
    notes: |
      Have a wild guess :)
  - title: Drill Baby Drill
    mp3Filename: ab-drill-baby-drill
    notes: |
      The pigeons will come home to roost one day.
  - title: Empathy of the Devil
    mp3Filename: ab-empathy-of-the-devil
    notes: |
      What do you don't like your own empathy for other human beings? Simple, the answer is to reframe it as a sin. Now you can hate and go to heaven!
  - title: Let 'Em Steal
    mp3Filename: ab-let-em-steal
    notes: |
      The politicians seem quite quick to bow down to our tech overlords and sell us down the river with their 'opt-out' approach. I wonder what is in it for them?
  - title: Think of the Children
    mp3Filename: ab-think-of-the-children
    notes: |
      Personal rights versus protecting the young. No easy answers, but we need to tread thoughtfully and being thoughtful isn't something we often see.
  - title: Backslide Backsliding
    mp3Filename: ab&a_backslide_backsliding
    notes: |
      A collaboration with @apolez. It was fun to try a bit of a different vocal delivery style and to dust off the Vox wah pedal too.
  - title: Suffer For My Art
    mp3Filename: ab_sw_suffer_for_my_art
    notes: |
      Thanks to @lyricslinger for the words. It was fun trying to capture a gothic feel to accompany them.
  - title: Glorious Imperfection

      Thanks to @johnkaniecki for the words to my suggested title. It was fun putting them to music and I hope it is at least a bit fun listening to the result.
